    HTML is a markup language that is typically used for designing web pages and it stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. Hyper Text Markup Language breaks down and explains how a web page is structured and how things on the web page are displayed. HTML is a series of elements and these elements display headings, paragraphs, links, and more.

      I chose to take this Web Page Design class for a few different reasons. One of the reasons is the fact that I wanted to be able to learn how to create my own web page. My dad has his own business and I have a small business as well, so I thought it would be helpful to know how to create a web page for future reference. Other than that, I just think that this would be a fun class to take and learn about overall.
